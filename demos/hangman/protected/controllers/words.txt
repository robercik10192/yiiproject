Did Comey have concerns, which he documented at the time, with how Trump understood (or misunderstood) the proper relationship between a president and an FBI director? If so, are there examples of incidents that worried him?
Did Trump directly ask Comey to end or curtail the Russia investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn? If so, why didn't Comey report it to someone?
There's lots and lots of other questions that Comey can answer in Thursday's hearing. And his answers are the sort of stuff that could have explosive consequences for this president and this White House -- particularly given how adamant Trump has been that all of the reporting on his conversations with Comey is totally wrong.
